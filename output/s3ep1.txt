What colour is our car? It's red. I win. The family have arrived at the mountains. We'll have a fantastic view when we get to the top. We're here. Look at the lovely sunny view. Oh dear, it has started to rain. Where's the lovely view? There's a lovely view. It is Miss Rabbit's ice cream store. Hello Miss Rabbit. Hello, Daddy Pig. Four ice creams, please. What flavours would you like? Mint, orange, strawberry and blueberry, please. OK. Look what I've got. Ice cream! There are favourite colours. That's right. Green for me. Orange for me. Strawberry red for me. And George's is. No! LUMMIC! Look! The sun has come out. And look what else has come out? A rainbow! Pepper and George love rainbows. A rainbow only comes out when it's rainy and sunny at the same time. Woo! It's got all our favourite colours in it. Yes! Red, orange, and green and blue. And do you know what you find at the end of a rainbow? No. You find treasure. Oh! Can we go find the treasure now? OK. The end of the rainbow looks like it's just on the next hill. Let's go! Wee! It's a rainy, sunny day. The rainbow's here to play. Rainbow, rainbow. Red, orange, and yellow and green and purple and blue. Rainbow, rainbow. It's a rainy, sunny day. Here we are! Oh! Where's our rainbow gone? It's moved to the next hill. You cheeky rainbow. Quick! Let's catch it! Rainbow, rainbow. It's a rainy, sunny day. It stopped raining. And the rainbow is gone. Don't worry, George. Maybe the rainbow has left some treasure behind. There's something over here. Have you found the rainbow treasure? Yes, I have. A big, muddy, puddle. Hi! This is the best rainbow treasure ever. Petrol's caught. It is a school day. Pepper and her friends are having a music lesson. Miss Poly had a doll. Sorry, Madame Gazelle. Oh dear, Pedro has a cough. Not to worry, I'll ring Dr. Brownbear. Dr. Brownbear speaking. Hello, Dr.. This is Madame Gazelle. A child is ill. Don't panic. I'll come straight away. I'll come straight away. What seems to be the problem? I've got a cough. I see. Is it a tickly cough or a chesty cough? Erm, I don't know, but it goes like this. Hmm, and when did you get this cough? When Madame Gazelle started singing. It's nothing serious, but Pedro's cough may be catching. What do you mean catching? When one person has a cough, sometimes other people get that cough too. Do I need medicine? Just a little spoonful. I'm afraid it doesn't taste very nice. It tastes like a loud shoe full of charm. Thank you, Dr. Brownbear. Bye! Bye! As I thought, Pedro's cough is catching. Danny Dog and Susie sheep of court, Pedro's cough. Open wide. Err, it tastes of carpet flavoured yogurt. Err, it tastes of flowers. Well done for taking your medicine so well. Do you ever get ill, Dr. Brownbear? No, Pepa, I'm never ill. I eat an apple a day. Goodbye! Bye! It is home time and the children's parents are here to pick them up. Mommy, daddy, I've got a cough. Dr. Brownbear came to look after us. He gave us horrible medicine. Matam gazelle, can you sing your song now? Of course, Pepa. Oh, Mies, Polly had a dolly who was... Oh, dear, all the grownups have caught Pedro's cough. Dr. Brownbear speaking. This is Pepa pig. All the grownups are ill. Not to worry, Pepa. I'm on my way. Hello, everyone. Court Pedro's cough, have we? Very well. Stand in line and open wide. Mmm. Err, sure. It tastes like custard and oats, socks. Thank you for looking after us, Dr. Brownbear. Who looks after you when you're ill? No one looks after me. I'm never ill. Dear, Dr. Brownbear has caught Pedro's cough. Not to worry. Goodbye! Goodbye! Poor Dr. Brownbear. He's ill and there's no one to look after him. Oh! Who can that be? Hello! We've come to look after you. What, what, what, please, some fruit? Yay! And some cusses. And here is your medicine. Yeah! It tastes like... Jamie, yogurt, flavoured, custard, socks! And here's a song to make you feel better. Oh! The library. It is bedtime. Good night, Pepper. Good night, George. Can I have a story, please? Okay. I'll read you the Red Monkey book. But do we always have that one? The Red Monkey has a bath, clean this teeth, and goes to sleep. Err, yes. That is what happens. I'm going to sleep. Yes, that is what happens. Tell me to eat another story. The blue tiger, the green spider, the orange penguin. Oh! What's this one? The wonderful world of concrete. I've been looking for that. Is it your book, Daddy? It's a book I borrowed from the library. What's it? The library. It's a place you borrow books from. When you finished reading them, you take them back. But Daddy Pig has forgotten to take this book back. I have had it for rather a long time. Never mind. You can take it back tomorrow. But now, it's bedtime. After Daddy reads this story. It's not much of a story, Pepper. Please read it, Daddy. Okay. The wonderful world of concrete. Concrete is a construction material composed of sand, water and chemical admixtures. Chapter 1. Sand. Pepper, George and Mummy Pig have fallen asleep. It is morning. Pepper and her family have come to the library. Wow! What a little bit! Shh, Pepper. You must be quiet in the library. Why? Because people come here to read and to be quiet. Next, please. Miss Rabbit is the librarian. Hello, Mummy Pig. Are you returning these books? Yes. This rabbit. Right you are. Why is the computer beeping? It's checking to see that you haven't been naughty and borrowed the book for too long. I may have borrowed this book for a bit too long. Don't worry, Daddy Pig. It can't be that bad. Gosh! Daddy Pig, you've had this book out for ten years. naughty daddy. Sorry Miss Rabbit. That's all right. Now you can borrow another book. Miss Rabbit, can George and I borrow a book, please? Yes. The children's section is over here. Oh look. Very flowers. Pretty dresses. Hello Pepper. Oh, hello, Johnny. I'm borrowing the book about football. Hello Pepper. Hello, CZ. I've got a book about nurses. George has chosen a book about dinosaurs. I saw. Look what I found. Further adventures in the world of concrete. Here's a red monkey book. Not the red monkey book. It's boring. But this is a different story. It might be more fun. I bet it's not. Once upon a time, there was a red monkey. Yada Barp cleaned his teeth and went to bed. No. He jumped in a space rocket and went to the moon. He had a picnic with the dinosaurs. Swam under the sea and climbed the highest mountain. That was a busy day. The end. Wow! Read it again. We can borrow it and read it at home, Pepper. But I was going to choose this book or this one. You can take three books home if you want, Pepper. You pee. But you must remember to bring them back on time. Yes, Miss Rabbit. And you must remember to bring your book back to Daddy Pig. I'll make sure Daddy remembers. Yes, Pepper. I'm sure you will. Ho, ho, ho. The campers are on. Pepper and George are very excited today. They are going on a holiday. Oh, where's Daddy? He's bringing a secret surprise. What's that? It's a camper van. We've borrowed it for our holiday. This camper van has everything. This button works the sink. Wow! And this button works the TV. What does this button do? I'm not sure. Maybe don't press it until we know. Is everybody ready to go on holiday? Yes, Mummy Pig. Then let's go! We're going on holiday and a camper van. Hmm. This map is a bit tricky. Daddy, we don't want to get lost. Don't worry, Pepper. I'm an expert in map reading. Oh, that's strange. Are we lost? Uh, yes. It's Granddad Dog with Danny Dog. Hello, Pepper. Hello, Danny. We're lost. Lost? Is your sat nav broken? Sat nav? You're driving a camper van T3200. Sat nav comes a standard. Welcome to the car of the future. Ah, so that's what that button does. Where are we going today? The camper van is talking. Clever, isn't it? The computer voice helps you find your way. But how does it know where we want to go? You tell it. Uh, hello, Mrs. camper van. Hello. We're going on holiday. Can you tell us the way? Proceed on the current road in a straight line. Thanks for your help, Granddad Dog. You're welcome. Have a lovely holiday. We're going on holiday in a camper van. Danger, danger, oil is low. What's oil? Oil helps engines to run smoothly. Will the oil run out? No, these warnings always give you plenty of time. Oil is gone. Oh, dear. Luckily, I've got a spare can of oil. Well done, Daddy Pig. We simply pour the oil into the engine and... Oh. What's wrong? There's nothing in here. The engines... It's mummy sheep with Susie sheep. Hello, Susie. Hello, Peppa. We've lost our engine. Lost your engine? Yes. It's completely disappeared. I'd like to help, but I don't know a thing about engines. I'm probably just being silly, but this looks a bit like an engine. Oh, yes. Well spotted, mummy sheep. The camper van has its engine at the back. There. That should be enough oil. Thank you, mummy sheep. You're welcome. Have a lovely holiday. Are we nearly there yet? Just up the next hill. You have reached your destination. Hurrah! Time for bed. Where will we sleep? Mummy pig and I will sleep on this bed. And you two will sleep upstairs. But there isn't an upstairs. Oh, watch this. The camper van roof isn't lifting up. The camper van is just like our little house. While we're on holiday, it is our little house. Good night, my little pigies. Good night.
